# humor-styles

This data was collection with an interactive online version of the Humor Styles Questionnaire from

Martin, R. A., Puhlik-Doris, P., Larsen, G., Gray, J., & Weir, K. (2003). Individual differences in uses of humor and their relation to psychological well-being: Development of the Humor Styles Questionnaire. Journal of Research in Personality, 37, 48-75.

In this notebook, I analyze humor styles by age and gender. Just for fun, I also try building a few machine learning models.
